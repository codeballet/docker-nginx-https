# Introduction to Nginx with HTTPS on Docker

This project aims to provide an example of how to set up the official Nginx Docker image with HTTPS encryption. The SSL certificates are provided by Let's Encrypt, using the `certbot/certbot` Docker image.

## About the use of docker volumes

As explained in the documentation for Certbot under [Where are my certificates](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#where-certs), do note that `/etc/letsencrypt/archive` and `/etc/letsencrypt/keys` contain all keys and certificates, while `/etc/letsencrypt/live` symlinks to the latest versions. Hence, it is important to include the entire `/etc/letsencrypt/` directory for the relevant docker volume, not just the `/etc/letsencrypt/live` directory.

Without the entire `/etc/letsencrypt/` directory, the certificates and keys will not be found inside the docker containers, as the symlinks has no actual files to link to.

## Testing Certbot with `--dry-run`

First, make sure the Nginx webserver is running, and that any SSL parts of the Nginx config is commented out. In other words, only use a server context on port 80 in Nginx. Then enter command:

```
docker compose run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ --dry-run -d <server_name>
```

## Aquiring certificates from Let's encrypt

To aquire the necessary certificates, run the same command as for testing certbot, but without the `--dry-run` flag.

```
docker compose run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ -d <server_name>
```

## SSL configuration

The SSL configuration is acquired from Mozilla's [SSL Configuration Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/) with the following settings:

- Server Software: nginx
- Mozilla Configuration: Modern
- Environment:
  - Server Version: 1.23.1
  - OpenSSL Version: 3.0.5
- Miscellaneous
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
  - OCSP Stapling disabled

## How to install Docker on a server

Install from the docker repo:
