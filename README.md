## Testing Certbot with `--dry-run`

First, make sure the Nginx webserver is running, and that any SSL parts of the Nginx config is commented out. In other words, only use a server context on port 80 in Nginx. Then enter command:

```
docker compose run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ --dry-run -d <server_name>
```

## Install Docker on server

As a quick script from get.docker.com:
